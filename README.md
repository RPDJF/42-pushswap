# ðŸš€ 42 PushSwap ðŸš€

What up, fellow code adventurers! This GitHub space is where I've stashed the 42 PushSwap project - a real head-scratcher from the 42 course. Feel free to peek into my coding escapades, but remember, tackle the challenges solo before diving into my solutions, okay?

## What's PushSwap, Anyway?

PushSwap is a coding journey that'll test your sorting prowess. It's like a sorting showdown where you get to flex those algorithm muscles! ðŸ’ª

## Compile-it! ðŸ’»

Here's the spellbook for conjuring your PushSwap masterpiece:

- `make`: Standard enchantment. Compile the code, and you're ready to roll!
- `make bonus`: Feeling spicy? Add the bonus ingredients for an extra kick.
- `make clean`: Sweep away the traces of your enchantment. A clean workspace is a happy workspace.
- `make fclean`: Need a fresh start? This erases all enchantments, leaving nothing behind.
- `make debug`: Unleash the debug sorcery with lldb. Warning: It leaves behind extra mystical artifacts not handled by `make fclean`.

Navigate this magical realm with these commands, and may your PushSwap journey be epic! ðŸŒŸðŸ”®

## Cloning the Repository
To embark on this coding quest, use the command:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:RPDJF/42-pushswap.git
```
